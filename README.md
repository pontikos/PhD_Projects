# PhD Projects

Projects undertaken during my PhD, mostly flow cytometry projects.

## IL2RA

IL2RA also known as CD25 is expressed on the surface of various immune cells.
The main objective of the study was the correlation between genotype, age and sex with CD25.

## IL2

An ex-vivo IL2 stimulation experiment where the response measured as pSTAT% was assessed in various cell types.

## KIR imputation

The KIR locus is a region of common copy number variation which is not directly assayable by SNP genotyping.
By doing qPCR and genotyping on the same samples it is possible to discover patterns in the SNPs signal which predict copy number of two KIR genes.
